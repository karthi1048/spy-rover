# Spy-Rover

Final Year Project Spotlight: Intelligent Spy Rover Using Raspberry Pi

This project was designed to support military surveillance, rescue operations, and border patrolling by providing remote visual access to hazardous or inaccessible areas.

Project Objective:

To build a portable, low-cost, and intelligent surveillance rover capable of detecting threats, storing evidence, and supporting remote monitoring in real time.

Key Functionalities & Innovations:

Live Streaming Feed - Real-time video transmitted using Pi Camera and Flask-based web interface

Footage Storage - Local storage of both video and audio data for review and evidence collection

Person Detection using YOLO - Integrated YOLOv3 for smart detection and tracking of humans, enhancing the system's situational awareness

Metal Detection Sensor - Embedded to detect landmines or metallic threats, suitable for defense and disaster zones

Remote Control Interface - Web-based dashboard enabling control from any device with a browser

Laser Aiming System - Prototype of a future defense feature for auto-targeting and threat marking

Technology Stack Used:

1. Raspberry Pi 4
2. Python
3. OpenCV & YOLOv3
4. Flask (for live control dashboard)
5. Metal sensor modules
6. Servo motors, Motor Driver L298N
7. Wireless communication (Wi-Fi-based control)

Future Scope:

I envision this rover being scaled with GPS tracking, thermal imaging, night vision, and possibly autonomous pathfinding using LIDAR or SLAM algorithms.
